**Hugo** is an open-source static website generator built with the Go programming language. It enables users to create static websites quickly and manage them easily. Notably, Hugo uses a simple and fast file structure to generate websites with various themes and flexible options.

To deploy a Hugo website using AWS, we can utilize AWS services like **CodeCommit**, **CodeBuild**, **CodePipeline**, and **S3 Static Website Hosting**. Specifically:
- **CodeCommit**: Used to store the source code of the Hugo website. Users can create a source code repository on CodeCommit and push the source code of the Hugo project there.
- **CodeBuild**: Used to build the Hugo website. A buildspec.yml file will be created to specify the steps needed in the build process, including installing Hugo and building the website from the source code.
- **CodePipeline**: Used to automate the deployment process of the Hugo website. A pipeline will be created, combining steps from CodeCommit (source), CodeBuild (build), and deployment to S3 (hosting).
- **S3 Static Website Hosting**: Used to store and serve the Hugo website as static content. Upon completion of the deployment process, the files of the Hugo website will be pushed to an S3 bucket, becoming a static website accessible over the internet.

In summary, deploying a Hugo website using AWS services brings automation and high performance to the development and deployment process of the website.
